# OpenInIE
This add-on enables you to open a link or the current page in a new Internet Explorer window. No more copying and pasting links for those sites that refuse to function correctly in Firefox!

## How it works
* Right-click on a link, and from the context menu select 'Open in IE'
* Click the 'Open in IE' toolbar button to open the current page in IE
* Press Alt + Shift + E to open the current page in IE
